# Thumbnail Generation

Dominant Color Extraction:
Extract and use the dominant colors to create ultra-lightweight color block previews
Only ~100 bytes of data but gives the overall color impression
Used by Google Photos, Medium, and other modern sites
Blurhash/Thumbhash:
Create a blurry placeholder representation using minimal data (often <100 bytes)
Shows color distribution and rough composition
Excellent for progressive loading experiences
LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders):
Extremely compressed versions (like 10-20kb) that load instantly
Often combined with blur effects to hide compression artifacts
Color Quantization:
Reduce the color palette to 8-64 colors, dramatically reducing file size
Particularly effective for thumbnails where exact color reproduction isn't critical
Selective Edge Information:
Keep edge details sharper while blurring less important areas
Gives the visual "shape" while reducing data
For implementation, you could modify your create_thumbnail function to:
Further reduce quality (to ~60-70%)
Apply Gaussian blur to hide compression artifacts
Limit the color palette
Consider formats like AVIF or WebP that are more efficient
