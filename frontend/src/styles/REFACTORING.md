## Remaining Tasks

1. **Audit CSS Classes**
   - Review and clean up any remaining inline styles

## Implementation Notes

### Theme Usage

The theme is now being used consistently across components:

```tsx
const StyledComponent = styled.div`
  color: ${({ theme }) => theme.colors.text.primary};
  padding: ${({ theme }) => theme.spacing.md};
`;
```

### Style Organization

Component styles are now organized by their respective components:

- `App.styles.ts` - Contains all styles for App.tsx
- `Timeline.styles.ts` - Contains all styles for Timeline.tsx
- `PhotoGallery.styles.ts` - Contains all styles for PhotoGallery.tsx

### Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining tasks above to finish the style refactoring
2. Consider adding responsive design improvements
3. Test the app thoroughly to ensure styling works correctly across all components

### Future Enhancements

1. Consider adding a dark mode theme
2. Add more reusable styled components for common UI patterns
3. Implement responsive design improvements
